# YAML Viewer — IntelliJ IDEA Plugin

A navigable, human-readable tree/table view for any YAML file, rendered next to the raw text editor. Inspired by OpenAPI/Swagger UI, but generalized for arbitrary YAML — Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, CI configs, application settings, anything.

## Features

- **Split editor** — raw YAML on the left, rendered tree view on the right, same as the built-in Markdown preview.
- **Hybrid tree + table rendering** — nested mappings collapse into sections; mappings of scalars render as compact key/value/type tables.
- **Type badges** — `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `null` shown inline so you can spot bad values at a glance.
- **Bidirectional sync** — click a node in the tree to jump to the line in the editor; move the caret in the editor and the tree selects the matching node.
- **Search & filter** — `Cmd/Ctrl+F` focuses the filter; type to narrow the tree by key or value; `Escape` clears.
- **Breadcrumb navigation** — the current selection's full path (e.g. `spec > template > containers > [0]`) shown above the tree, each segment clickable.
- **Invalid-YAML tolerant** — keeps showing the last valid view while you're mid-edit, with a status line, instead of going blank.
- **Schema-agnostic** — no special-casing for Kubernetes, OpenAPI, or anything else. Works with any well-formed YAML.
- **Zero external dependencies** — built on IntelliJ's bundled YAML PSI.
